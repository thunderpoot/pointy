NAME
        Pointy - Present IEEE 754 floating point values

SYNOPSIS
        # Run with no options for interactive mode
        pointy

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a visual representation of IEEE 754 floating point
    numbers.  In interactive mode the following keys are available:

        - Left / right arrow-keys to navigate bit array
        - Up / down arrow-keys to flip bits on or off
        - 1 / 0 keys to input bits manually
        - + / - keys to adjust colour index
        - Delete / backspace to set current bit to 0
        - Tab key / ^I (Control-I) to switch fields for direct input
        - ? / H key to show this help document

    Options
        [-? | -help ]
            Show this help document and quit

        [-decimal] <value>
            Present decimal <value> and quit

        [-hexadecimal] <value>
            Present hexadecimal <value> and quit

        [-nocolour]
            Do not use colours (colours are 16-bit)

        [-colour] <index>
            Adjust colour index (range: -80 to 175)

        [-unicode]
            Use Unicode characters (default is DEC Special Graphics)

        [-ascii]
            Use ASCII characters only

        [-version]
            Print current version and quit

    Examples
        # Display hex value with no colour
        pointy -n -hex deadbeef

        # Display decimal value
        pointy -d 123
